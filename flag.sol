Here we go!!!
I downloaded the file and found out that I can't run it so a changed the permissions so I can.

chmod -755 flag
./flag
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.

Ooooooh. That'll be fun. Let's go to gdb.

This Implies that the file is protected from debuging. Lets try this.

strings flag | grep UPX
UPX!

Oh yeah. Lets fix that.

install upx if you don't have it

sudo apt-get install upx

upx -d flag
